A few LAS manipulations

## Blueprint
We want a quick tool to generate all our usual metrics but on a specific region. Namely all ditches.
All ditches points are known thanks to the `ahn4clust-dec1-wc` dataset.

Params of new function:
+ gt_file: ground truth file
+ eval_file: the file to evaluate
+ filter_file: the file on which the filtering is being done
+ filter_class: an integer representing the class on which the filtering should be done.
